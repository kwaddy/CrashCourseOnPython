# Title: Binary Computation
# Written by Kayla Waddy
# June 28th, 2023
# Description: This personal project will explore how to write
# a program in python to convert a binary input from the user
# to a decimal number (i.e. from 10111000 to the decimal
# equivalent). This wil explore the connection between two
# different classes I am taking and how one's teachings
# can be cross translated. Will update this as need be.
